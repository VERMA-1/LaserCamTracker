# LaserCamTracker

LaserTracker is a Python-based system for real-time laser point tracking using computer vision techniques and servo control. It detects and tracks a laser point within a video feed, adjusting the position of a camera mounted on servo motors to keep the laser centered on a detected circular reference point.

# Features
+ Real-time laser point detection and tracking using a webcam
+  Utilizes a pan and tilt setup with mounted lasers for precise positioning
+ Suitable for security camera systems and experimental setups
+ Detects and tracks circular reference points, adjusting the laser position accordingly
  
# Requirements
- Python 3.x with OpenCV and NumPy
- Arduino IDE for servo control
- Compatible webcam, Arduino nano board, 2 axis pan and tilt setup with mounted lasers(green),7805,Sg90,adapter,DC Jack,Jumper wire,Mini BreadBoard
