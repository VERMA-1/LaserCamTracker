# LaserCamTracker

LaserTracker is a Python-based system for real-time laser point tracking using computer vision techniques and servo control. It detects and tracks a laser point within a video feed, adjusting the position of a camera mounted on servo motors to keep the laser centered on a detected circular reference point.

# Features
- Real-time laser point detection and tracking using a webcam
* Utilizes a pan and tilt setup with mounted lasers for precise positioning
* Suitable for security camera systems and experimental setups
* Detects and tracks circular reference points, adjusting the laser position accordingly
